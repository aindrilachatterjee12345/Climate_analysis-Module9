# key differences between the June and December data
The mean temp is four deg less in Dec than June.These data determine whether the seasons could affect the surf and ice cream shop business and we see that there are enough customers between seasons to sustain the business throughout the year. The recommendation is to see more granularity of data like determining the count of visitors, the type of ice creams and other activities can be looked into ..more data analysis can be done to get more detailed information so that the sales would be increaesd. 

Apart from the mean temp difference that I have already mentioned the min temp is 56 deg in dec whereas it is 64 deg in june. The max temp in june is 85 and in dec it is 83 deg. so there is not much of a difference in the max temp.
